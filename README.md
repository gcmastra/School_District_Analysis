This graphic shows the summary data per school before the Thomas HS 9th grade data has been changed.

Here is a graphic which shows the per school summary frame AFTER the numbers for Thomas HS have been updated.  When 9th grade test scores are excluded from the totals, the average test scores go down.  This does not suggest the 9th grade test scores were fabricated to make the school averages look better - in other words "dishonesty" may not have been the motive.  While the new percentages do not prove whether test scores were altered, on the contrary they suggest it could have been an honest mistake and perhaps an audit of the tests themselves would reveal the source of the error.

### Comments to be included in the Module 4 Survey

In my opinion this was a very difficult challenge assignment. It was very long and had too many steps. I did not enjoy this challenge.
